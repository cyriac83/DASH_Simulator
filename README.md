# DASH_Simulator
DASH simulator

This program mimics the basic operation of an HTTP Adaptive Streaming (HAS) client. 

Adaptation algorithms: There are two adaptation algorithms, last segment and harmonic mean estimator

Bandwidth: There are two bandwidth variation setup, moderate fluctuation (where mean is 4 Mbps and standard deviation is 2 Mbps) and extreme fluctuation (where mean is 4 Mbps and standard deviation is 4 Mbps). In both cases, bandwidth values follow a normal distribution and are generated for every 1 ms

Input: The only input that is required is size of the video segments. However, there are other inputs which the program expects, which you can comment according to your needs
